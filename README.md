# Android-Catppuccin
A collection of styles to attempt to style Android with a soothing pastel theme.

# NOTE:

These styles are not made or endorsed by Catppuccin, It is an unofficial port.

# Setup

The Material You theme requires use of Shizuku, Learn how to set that up [here.](https://shizuku.rikka.app/)

It also needs [ColorBlendr](https://github.com/Mahmud0808/ColorBlendr) to apply the theme.

For the keyboard, you need to use [HeliBoard](https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard), as it was the one I made the styles for. Learn how to apply the theme [here.](https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/wiki/Customization#theme-colors)
